# Gait Pattern Analysis for Neurological Degenerative Diseases

This repository contains code and experiments for analyzing gait time series data using image-based techniques. The goal is to study gait patterns associated with neurological degenerative diseases by transforming 1D time series into 2D image representations using Gramian Angular Fields (GAF).

## Objective

To generate GAF representations from gait time series data for four neurological conditions:
- Parkinson’s Disease
- Huntington’s Disease
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
- Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

## Current Progress

- [x] Data preprocessing and normalization
- [x] GAF generation for each disease dataset
- [ ] Visual comparison and exploratory analysis
- [ ] Classification model training
- [ ] Evaluation and result analysis
